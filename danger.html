conflicts in git are a common occurrence when multiple developers are working on the same codebase. They happen when two or more branches have made changes to the same lines of code, and Git is unable to automatically merge them. 

When a conflict occurs, Git will mark the affected files as "conflicted" and will require manual intervention to resolve the conflict. The developer will need to open the conflicted file and decide which changes to keep, or how to combine the changes from both branches.
